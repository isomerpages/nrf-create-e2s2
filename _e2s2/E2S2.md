**Launch of E2S2 Phase 2** 

The second phase of E2S2 was officially launched on 26th November 2018. This second phase of the program will build on the results and findings in the first phase to translate into applications to solve real world problems. The strengths of the program are the test-bedding at different scales and complexity in the cities of Singapore and Shanghai..

ABOUT Energy and Environmental Sustainability for Megacities (E2S2)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This program is a major collaboration between Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), one of the leading universities in China, and National University of Singapore (NUS). This is supported under the Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) framework to study sustainable solutions for coupled problems targeted at already-stressed megacities and serve as inputs for strategic policy making and near real-time environmental monitoring and response.

E2S2, hosted under NUS Environmental Research Institute (NERI), aims to develop a platform to facilitate the understanding, design, and implementation of infrastructure and sustainability solutions for coupled problems in future cities. It will start with two sites of different sizes and complexities, in this case a megacity like Shanghai and a land-scarce city like Singapore. It also proposes to develop capabilities needed in solving coupled problems characteristic of complex city systems. These include sensing, modeling, data mining, systems modeling, carefully designed test bedding systems and adaption, and scalability of coupled solutions to a variety of environments. This will then allow us to adapt solutions to other cities with different complexities and sizes based on a calibrated modeling platform and through subsequent smaller-scale test-bedding.
